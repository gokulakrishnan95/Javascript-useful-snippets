//removing duplicates from an array

var x = [1,2,3,4,5,5,6,6,6];
var y = [];
for(var i =0;i<x.length;i++){

//array.indexOf(val)<0 returns false when val is present in the array
if(y.indexOf(x[i]) < 0){
y.push(x[i]);
}
}
console.log(y);

//its a pure javascript method along with inbuilt method.
//if you donot want use inbuilt method you have to run one more for loop for array y and we have to check whether the value is present or not
//in ES6 there is a method called [...new Set(Array)] also removes duplicates
